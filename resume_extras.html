      <li> Radio automation and scheduling software as an open-source project for my college radio station, <a href='kups.net'>KUPS 90.1FM The Sound</a>. The software datamines music information from several online sources using available information from music files (using either metadata or filenames), and can also find new, currently-trending music to add to the rotation. After parsing and processing metadata, the software queries these same sources for several metrics of popularity (enabling the software to rank the frequency with which the music should be played) as well as for genres, subgenres, and similar artists associated with the music. Finally, using these various classification features, the software generates playlists of similar music using a k-nearest-neighbors approach (randomly selecting the next track from the k neighbors, weighted by closeness).</li>
