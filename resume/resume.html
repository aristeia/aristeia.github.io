<ul>
<li>I installed several programs onto their servers for the purpose of analyzing stock positions and portfolios.</li>
<li>Risktech writes customized software for individual firms based on their market analysis needs. Rather than rewriting redundant code for similar problems, they want to look into an open source platform on which to write customized software.</li>
<li>My role was to install and test the Opengamma platform for them in order to achieve an open source solution.</li>
<li>I analyzed the potential costs and benefits of developing atop Opengamma .</li>
<li>I also began the reconstruction of a corrupted Oracle database.</li>

<p><em>Communications Engineer and Webmaster</em>, August 2015 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked on several software projects for the station, most notibly a new radio automation system/scheduling software as an open-source project. The software datamines music information from several online sources using available information from music files (using either metadata or filenames), and can also find new, currently-trending music to add to the rotation. After parsing and processing metadata, the software queries these same sources for several metrics of popularity (enabling the software to rank the frequency with which the music should be played) as well as for genres, subgenres, and similar artists associated with the music. Finally, using these various classification features, the software generates playlists of similar music using a k-nearest-neighbors approach (randomly selecting the next track from the k neighbors, weighted by closeness).</li>
<li>Additionally, performed basic systems administration tasks on the various computer systems used within the station, as well as regular maintenance of the website <a href="www.kups.net">kups.net</a>.</li>
