<p><em>Software Engineer, Machine Learning</em>, June 2016 - December 2016</p>
<ul>
<li>Perform predictive analytics on customer data attributes using Python and its scikit-learn library.</li>
<li>Implemented a data cleansing and validation mechanism to make unstructured JSON data into feature vectors in a way that scales for 168,000 unique feature-value pairs to be persisted to disk for 118 million customers.</li>
<li>Tuned and automated training on predictive models using these feature vectors.</li>
<li>Implemented a prediction verification mechanism to determine the accuracy of the predictions over time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Software Engineer, Mobile Automation Testing</em>, January 2017 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Designed and implemented a system for functional testing, continuous integration, and deployment for iOS apps on real devices.</li>
<li>Enhanced our STF-based android testing system through validation testing and healing services. These services ensure that at any given point, our android devices and their providers are always operating properly. If a heal cannot fix whatever problem is going on, we receive an alert in slack with information about the problem so we can manually asses the situation.</li>
<li>These tools and services include a flask-based dashboard for assigning performance tests to devices, webhooks and integrations communicating from Grafana's alerts to the dashboard for healing to slack for output, and many others running as systemd-initiated Docker containers.</li>
<li>Scripted the provisioning and configuration of general Android devices using Python's uiautomator and Android's ADB frameworks so that they can be integrated into our STF-based device farm seamlessly.</li>
<li>Assisted T-Mobile Java app developers with integration into our device farm, instructing and documenting for them how to develop JUnit/TestNG tests with the UIAutomator/Espresso UI testing frameworks.</li>

<p><em>President and Project Organizer</em>, August 2013 - May 2016</p>
<ul>
<li>I participated in this club through several projects since the beginning of college, and was elected as its project organizer and president for my last year.</li>
<li>We hosted several hackathons, including the <a href="http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/acm-icpc/">ACM's intercollegiate programming competition</a>.</li>

<p><em>Communications Engineer and Webmaster</em>, August 2015 - May 2016</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked on several software projects for the station, most notably a new radio automation system/scheduling software as an open-source project. The software uses information from music files to datamine exact music metadata from online sources, and also finds currently-trending music to add to the rotation. After validating music files with this metadata, the software queries these same sources for several metrics of popularity (enabling the software to rank the frequency with which the music should be played) as well as for genres, subgenres, and similar artists. Using these various classification features, playlists of similar music are generated using a k-nearest-neighbors approach.</li>
<li>Additionally, performed basic systems administration tasks on the various computer systems used within the station, as well as regular maintenance of the website <a href="http://www.kups.net/">kups.net</a>.</li>
