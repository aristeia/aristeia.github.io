<li>We've worked on a Rover project this past year, automating the driving of an RC car using Arduino ultrasonic sensors.</li>
<li>From last summer, we built a native IOS/Android/web app Eventi <a href="http://eventi.pugetsound.edu/">(view the web app at eventi.pugetsound.edu)</a>, a method of viewing campus event posters from a mobile device as well as posting event information for our campus community.</li>

<p><em>Communications Engineer and Webmaster</em>, August 2015 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked on several software projects for the station, most notibly a new radio automation system/scheduling software as an open-source project. The software datamines music information from several online sources using available information from music files (using either metadata or filenames), and can also find new, currently-trending music to add to the rotation. After parsing and processing metadata, the software queries these same sources for several metrics of popularity (enabling the software to rank the frequency with which the music should be played) as well as for genres, subgenres, and similar artists associated with the music. Finally, using these various classification features, the software generates playlists of similar music using a k-nearest-neighbors approach (randomly selecting the next track from the k neighbors, weighted by closeness).</li>
<li>Additionally, performed basic systems administration tasks on the various computer systems used within the station, as well as regular maintenance of the website <a href="www.kups.net">kups.net</a>.</li>
