<ul>
<li>Worked with Ruby on Rails to develop a web application for financial analysis.</li>
<li>My tasks involved calculations on the performance of portfolios containing 500+ companies over 20+ years, dealing with rebalances when securities were sold, and comparing the returns for different types of portfolio compositions (S&amp;P, diversified, and stratified).</li>

<p><em>Junior Linux Systems Administrator</em>, June 2013 - August 2013</p>
<ul>
<li>Risktech writes customized software for individual firms based on their market analysis needs. Rather than rewriting redundant code for similar problems, they wanted to look into an open source platform on which to write customized software.</li>
<li>My role was to install and test the <a href="https://github.com/OpenGamma/OG-Platform">Opengamma platform</a> for them in order to achieve an open source solution.</li>
<li>I analyzed the potential costs and benefits of developing atop Opengamma.</li>

<li>In the summer of 2014, I designed a website at <a href="">j-walking.biz</a> for another client's dog-walking business (but has since been deactivated).</li>
<li>In the fall of 2012, my uncle needed a website to show off his restaurant to the world. I wrote the website's code and set up its hosting, viewable at <a href="http://www.tomsgrill.net/">tomsgrill.net</a>.</li>

<li><p><strong><a href="http://acm.pugetsound.edu">Association for Computing Machinery</a></strong> (University of Puget Sound)</p>
<p><em>President and Project Organizer</em>, August 2013 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>I've participated in this club through several projects since the beginning of freshman year, and have served as its project organizer and president for the past year.</li>
<li>We've hosted several hackathons, including the <a href="http://mathcs.pugetsound.edu/acm-icpc/">ACM's intercollegiate programming competition</a>.</li>
<li>We've worked on a Rover project this past year, automating the driving of an RC car using Arduino ultrasonic sensors.</li>
<li>From last summer, we built a native IOS/Android/web app Eventi <a href="http://eventi.pugetsound.edu/">(view the web app here)</a>, a method of viewing campus event posters from a mobile device as well as posting event information for our campus community. I focused on the Ruby-on-Rails backend, dealing with its API and database.</li>
<li>We've also constructed a pseudo-supercomputer, which can successfully run threaded programs in parallel, out of several raspberry pi computers.</li>

<p><em>Communications Engineer and Webmaster</em>, August 2015 - Present</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked on several software projects for the station, most notably a new radio automation system/scheduling software as an open-source project. The software uses information from music files to datamine exact music metadata from online sources, and also finds currently-trending music to add to the rotation. After validating music files with this metadata, the software queries these same sources for several metrics of popularity (enabling the software to rank the frequency with which the music should be played) as well as for genres, subgenres, and similar artists. Using these various classification features, playlists of similar music are generated using a k-nearest-neighbors approach.</li>
<li>Additionally, performed basic systems administration tasks on the various computer systems used within the station, as well as regular maintenance of the website <a href="http://www.kups.net/">kups.net</a>.</li>
