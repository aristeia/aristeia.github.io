    -   We've worked on a Rover project since August of 2015, automating the driving of an RC car using Arduino ultrasonic sensors.
    -   From the summer of 2015, we built a native IOS/Android/web app Eventi [(view the web app here)](http://eventi.pugetsound.edu/), a method of viewing campus event posters from a mobile device as well as posting event information for our campus community. I focused on the Ruby-on-Rails backend, dealing with its API and database.
    -   We've also constructed a pseudo-supercomputer, which can successfully run threaded programs in parallel, out of several raspberry pi computers. 

*   **[KUPS 90.1FM](http://www.kups.net/)** (University of Puget Sound)

    *Communications Engineer and Webmaster*, August 2015 - May 2016

    -   Worked on several software projects for the station, most notably a new radio automation system/scheduling software as an open-source project. The software uses information from music files to datamine exact music metadata from online sources, and also finds currently-trending music to add to the rotation. After validating music files with this metadata, the software queries these same sources for several metrics of popularity (enabling the software to rank the frequency with which the music should be played) as well as for genres, subgenres, and similar artists. Using these various classification features, playlists of similar music are generated using a k-nearest-neighbors approach.
    -   Additionally, performed basic systems administration tasks on the various computer systems used within the station, as well as regular maintenance of the website [kups.net](http://www.kups.net/).

*   **Additional Collegiate Involvement** (University of Puget Sound)

    -   Certified trip leader for Puget Sound Outdoors, as well as CPR and wilderness first-aid certified.
