<body><h1>802.11~ Specification</h1>

<center>
<h2>An overview of the UPS 802.11 project</h2></center>


<p><br>
</p><h2>Introduction:</h2>

The course project involves implementing a simplified version of the 
802.11 LLC/MAC layer atop the virtual RF layer you used in the previous 
assignment.  In other words, you will extend the broadcast-based 
communication facilities of the RF layer to provide access control and 
reliability, and offer these services to the layer above via a set of 
interface routines.  We will make the following simplifying assumptions:
<ol>
<li>No base station or distribution system
</li><li>All machines are within range of all others
</li><li>No fragmentation or reassembly
</li><li>No power management mechanisms
</li><li>WEP will not be supported
</li><li>Calls to interface routines will not be overlapped
</li></ol>
Your implementations will be expected to interoperate and share the RF 
layer as specified in the 802.11 specification.  The interface routines 
you implement will also be identical, so that a common test application 
can be used atop any of your implementation projects.  We shall call our
 version "802.11~", which is appropriate both because there are no more 
unused letters to designate 802.11 standards, and because we're "sort of
 802.11".

<a name="frame"></a>
</p><h2>Frame Format</h2>

The simplifications assumed in 802.11~ allow for a much less complex 
frame format than that required by the full 802.11.  The 802.11~ frame 
is shown below (in bytes), with the Control field expanded to show its 
contents (in bits):   

<p>
</p><center><img src="802.11_specification_files/frame.png" width="80%"></center>
<p>


</p><h3>Control Field</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Bits 0-2:
</dt><dd>These three bits describe the frame's type, with the five frame types below currently defined:
<blockquote><pre>000	Data
001	ACK
010	Beacon
100	CTS
101	RTS
</pre></blockquote>
</dd><dt>Bit 3:
</dt><dd>This bit is set if the frame is a retransmission.<p>
</p></dd><dt>Bits 4-15:
</dt><dd>The remaining 12 bits constitute a sequence number (a 12-bit 
unsigned integer) so that receiving stations can distinguish between and
 properly order frames.  Sequence numbers always start at zero, and wrap
 back to zero if they reach 2<sup>12</sup>-1.
</dd></dl>

<h3>Addresses</h3>

MAC addresses in 802.11~ are unsigned 16-bit integers.  The address consisting of all 1's (2<sup>16</sup>-1)
 is reserved as the broadcast address.  Both the destination and source 
addresses are included in all frame types, for consistency, though 
Beacon frames use the broadcast address as their destination.  

<!--The 802.11~ committee has apportioned sections of the MAC address space to the following implementors:

<ul>
<li>DuBois: 101&mdash;200</li>
<li>Finch: 201&mdash;300</li>
<li>Livingston: 301&mdash;400</li>
<li>Lund: 401&mdash;500</li>
<li>Marx: 501&mdash;600</li>
<li>Pastor: 601&mdash;700</li>
<li>Salas: 701&mdash;800</li>
<li>Spiegel: 801&mdash;900</li>
<li>Swanson: 901&mdash;1000</li>
<li>Taylor: 1001&mdash;1100</li>
</ul>
-->


<h3>Data</h3>

Data frames may carry up to 2038 bytes of data, giving a maximum frame size of 2048 (2K) bytes.

<h3>CRC</h3>

All frames carry a four-byte CRC checksum, computed using the same 
polynomial specified in IEEE 802.11.  Implementing the CRC checksum will
 be an extra-credit option for the 802.11~ project.  Packets sent from 
802.11~ implementations that do <i>not</i> compute valid checksums should fill the CRC field with 1s.

<h2>802.11~ Interface Routines — Java Versions</h2>

See the Java <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/doc/index.html">Documentation</a> for more details on the Java code that's provided.  The <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/doc/wifi/Dot11Interface.html">Dot11Interface</a> describes the routines that must be implemented as part of your 802.11~ layer.  They're presented briefly below.  <b>Note:</b> The <a "doc="" rf="" rf.html"="">RF layer</a> defines a variety of physical-layer constants that your implementation should reference.

<pre>int send(short&nbsp;dest, byte[]&nbsp;data, int&nbsp;len);
</pre>
<blockquote>
Send <tt>len</tt> bytes from <tt>data</tt> to the address specified in <tt>dest</tt>.  If <tt>len</tt> exceeds the size of the byte array, send as many bytes as <tt>data</tt> contains.
</blockquote>

<pre>int recv(Transmission&nbsp;t);
</pre>
<blockquote>
This function blocks until data arrives, at which point it writes the 
incoming data and address information into the Transmission instance 
passed as argument (respecting the size of the byte array in the 
Transmission) and returns the number of bytes received.
</blockquote>

<pre>int status();
</pre>
<blockquote>
This function returns a code representing the current status of the 
802.11~ layer.  The code reflects the most recent error, or the status 
of the most recent transmission or other operation.  Status codes 
include:
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<table cellspacing="10">
<tbody><tr><td><tt>1</tt></td><td><tt>SUCCESS</tt></td>
<td>Initial value if <tt>802_init</tt> is successful</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>2</tt></td><td><tt>UNSPECIFIED_ERROR</tt></td>
<td>General error code</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>3</tt></td><td><tt>RF_INIT_FAILED</tt></td>

<td>One or more arguments are invalid</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>10</tt></td><td><tt>INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER_SPACE</tt></td>
<td>Outgoing transmission rejected due to insufficient buffer space</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</blockquote>


<pre>int command(int&nbsp;cmd, int&nbsp;val);
</pre>
<blockquote>
This function provides a mechanism to pass command or configuration data
 to an 802.11~ layer at runtime.  One could use it to enable or disable 
debugging output on-the-fly, change system parameters, or prompt the 
802.11~ layer to summarize network activity, for example.  <b>Note:</b> User-defined command code values should be greater than 10.  A compliant 802.11~ implementation <i>must</i> support the following commands:
<p>


</p><dl>
<dt><b>Command 0</b>: Options and settings
</dt><dd>Should summarize all command options and report their current settings.  The accompanying value parameter is ignored.
<p>

</p></dd><dt><b>Command 1</b>:  Debug level.
</dt><dd>The meaning of non-zero values can be implementation dependent, but passing a value of 0 should disable all debugging output.
<p>

</p></dd><dt><b>Command 2</b>:  Slot selection.
</dt><dd>If the accompanying value parameter is 0 the link layer should 
select slots randomly.  Any other value should cause the link layer to 
always select <tt>maxCW</tt>.
<p>

</p></dd><dt><b>Command 3</b>:  Beacon interval.
</dt><dd>The accompanying value specifies the desired number of seconds between the <i>start</i> of beacon transmissions.  A value of -1 should disable the sending of beacon frames.
<p>

<!--
<dt><b>Command 4</b>:  Beep interval.
<dd>The accompanying value specifies the desired number of seconds between beeps.  A value of -1 should disable beeping.  When beeping is enabled, you should beep each time your local clock reaches a time value which is evenly divisible by the beep interval in milliseconds.
-->
</p></dd></dl>

<h2>802.11~ Interface Routines — C++ Versions</h2>

Note that none of these routines are <i>member functions</i> (methods).  Your implementation should be object oriented, but must still present a non-OO interface to the layer above.  <b>Note:</b>
 The RF layer defines a variety of physical-layer constants that your 
implementation should reference.  See lines 21 through 37 of <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/Code/C++/RF.h"><tt>RF.h</tt></a>.

<pre>int dot11_init(short MACaddr, ostream *output);
</pre>
<blockquote>
This routine must be called before any of the other 802.11~ routines are
 used.  The station adopts the 16-bit MAC address passed as argument.  
The second argument is an output stream to which diagnostic messages 
should be printed, unless the argument is null.
The call returns -1 on error and sets an internal error code.
</blockquote>
<p>

</p><pre>int dot11_send(short destAddr, char *buf, int bufSize);
</pre>
<blockquote>
This non-blocking function asks the 802.11~ layer to transmit <i>bufSize</i> bytes, starting at address <i>buf</i>,
 to the specified destination address.  The function returns the number 
of bytes queued for transmission, or -1 on error, in which case an 
internal error code is set.  Once the queued data is successfully 
transmitted and acknowledged, the internal status code is updated.
</blockquote>
<p>

</p><pre>int dot11_recv(short *srcAddr, short *destAddr, char *buf, int bufSize);
</pre>
<blockquote>
This function blocks until data arrives, at which point it returns the number of bytes of data copied into <i>buf</i>, respecting the size limit passed in via <i>bufSize</i>.
  The source and destination addresses are filled in as a result of the 
call.  (Only data addressed to this station is returned via <tt>802_recv</tt>, but <i>destAddr</i>
 can help a station determine whether the frame was broadcast to all 
stations, or addressed specifically to this station.)  If the buffer is 
too small to hold the entire data payload of the incoming transmission, 
the rest should be discarded.  The function returns -1 on error, and 
sets an internal error code.
</blockquote>
<p>

</p><pre>int dot11_status();
</pre>
<blockquote>
This function returns a code representing the current status of the 
802.11~ layer.  The code reflects the most recent error, or the status 
of the most recent transmission or other operation.  (See Java version 
above for list of status codes.)
</blockquote>

<p>

</p><pre>int dot11_command(int cmd, int val);
</pre>
<blockquote>
This function provides a mechanism to pass command or configuration data
 to an 802.11~ layer at runtime.  One could use it to enable or disable 
debugging output on-the-fly, change system parameters, or prompt the 
802.11~ layer to summarize network activity, for example.  <b>Note:</b> 
User-defined command code values should be greater than 10.   (See Java 
comments above for list of command codes that should be supported.)

<h2>Project Code:</h2>

If you're writing in Java, you don't need to know much about the project
 structure — just implement the 802.11~ interface routines in the <tt>LinkLayer</tt> class, add any additional classes you need to the <tt>wifi</tt> package, compile, then run the <tt>WiFiClient</tt> to <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/gui.png">test things out</a>.  The pieces will end up fitting together like this:

<p>
</p><center><img src="802.11_specification_files/layers_java.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>

Things get more complex if you implement your layer in C++.  The virtual
 physical layer (RF) is written in Java, as is the client.  This means a
 complete, running 802.11~ project really looks like a "C++ sandwich" — 
there's a Java layer on top, your C++ code in the middle, and Java again
 below your code:

</p><p>
</p><center><img src="802.11_specification_files/layers.png" width="40%"></center>
<p>

The good news is that whether you choose to work in C++ or Java, I'm giving you <i>all</i> you need except for the small matter of the code in <tt>LinkLayer</tt>, but even there I'm giving you a <i>starting point</i> — a file that compiles with the rest of the project to produce a running program.  (The current versions of <tt>linklayer.cpp</tt> and <tt>LinkLayer.java</tt> just call the RF layer directly when <tt>dot11</tt> interface routines are called.)

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/doc/index.html">Documentation</a> for all Java code I'm supplying.</li>

<li>Project files are available as an importable <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/Code/WiFiProject.zip">Eclipse project</a>.
  You'll need to replace the routines in LinkLayer.java with your own.  
At the moment, they pretty much do nothing, but at least there's enough 
there that the whole project compiles and runs.  (C++ code framework is <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/Code/C++.zip">here</a>.)</li>

<li>An <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/Code/monitor.jar">RF monitor</a> application that understands and displays 802.11~ packets and can help you debug your implementation.  It knows
enough about the RF layer to be able to report on transmissions and collisions,
and can wipe out transmissions if you tell it to.</li>

<li>A <a href="http://cs.pugetsound.edu/%7Ebrichards/Classes/325/Asmts/Project/Code/wifi.jar">working implementation</a> of the project.  You can test yours against it as you add functionality to your own.</li>

<!-- ================================================================= -->
<a name="tips"></a>
</p><h2>Tips:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you use a <tt>Packet</tt> class!  Hide all of those 
bit-mangling operations so you never have to see them again (after 
testing them thoroughly, of course.)  Make sure you implement a nice <tt>toString</tt> method (or overload the <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator in C++) so you can print packets easily.</li>

<li>Use a finite-state diagram to describe the MAC behavior before you 
start implementing.  Be sure it includes details of where and when the 
collision window is expanded as well as how ACKs are generated and sent.</li>

<li>When desigining your implementation, think about classes first and 
then threads — decompose the problem into classes, and then think about 
which pieces of functionality within a class will need to be implemented
 in separate threads.</li>

<li>Use the "nuke" and "jam" settings on the latest version of the 
monitor to help test your code:  Jam can be used to keep the channel 
busy, and nuke can test how your code responds to collisions.
</li></ul>


<!-- ================================================================= -->
<a name="grading"></a>
<h2>Grading:</h2>

The project will be divided into a series of checkpoints, to help guide 
your implementation and ensure that no one falls behind.  Each of the 
checkpoints is worth 5% of the overall project grade, and is pass/fail.
